/**
 * Problem 2 of 3
 *
 * A TaskDispatcher processes strings using multiple threads. Thread number is limited.
 * Each worker upper-cases the task string and records the result.
 * The results list and the completed counter must always be in sync.
 *
 * TODO 1 — pool
 *   Create a thread pool whose size is capped at POOL_SIZE.
 *
 * TODO 2 — lock
 *   Choose a lock that allows you to explicitly acquire and release it,
 *
 *
 * TODO 3 — dispatch(List<String> tasks)
 *   Hand each task off to the pool. The work each thread does is:
 *     (a) upper-case the string
 *     (b) record the result by calling recordResult()
 *     (c) return the result
 *   Give back a handle to each piece of work so the caller can retrieve
 *   the results later. Do not wait for the results here.
 *
 * TODO 4 — recordResult(String result)
 *   The results list and completedCount must never get out of sync.
 *   Make sure no other thread can come in between updating one and the other.
 *   Always release the lock even if something goes wrong.
 *
 * TODO 5 — shutdown()
 *   Stop accepting new work and wait up to 10 seconds for running tasks to finish.
 *
 * TODO 6 — getResults() / getCompletedCount()
 *   Reads must be guarded the same way writes are.
 *   getResults() must return a copy so callers cannot modify internal state.
 *
